# Contributing

This guide is written to be run rather than admired. Every rule below names the
command that shows whether the rule is met, and where no such command exists yet
the guide says so instead of implying one.

## Before you push

    ./build

That builds both layers from a fresh clone and is the same script the build
workflow runs, so a verdict here and a verdict there come from one procedure
rather than two.

It needs three things installed first, and it refuses rather than working around
any of them.

`rustup`, not a Rust toolchain installed some other way. The exact compiler is
pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`, rustup is what applies that file, and a `cargo`
that did not come from rustup builds with whatever version it happens to be.

Node, at the version `.nvmrc` pins. Nothing applies that file on its own, so the
script compares it against the `node` on your path and stops on a mismatch.
`nvm use` in this directory is the usual way to satisfy it. Editing `.nvmrc` to
match your machine is not, because the pin is the point.

A POSIX shell. On Windows that is the one that ships with git.

What the script does not do is run a formatter, a lint gate or a test suite,
because none of those exist yet. #3 adds formatting and lint, #4 adds the client
type gate, #5 adds the test harness and the coverage floor, and #6 puts them all
on the pull request under stable names. Until they land, `./build` says the tree
compiles and says nothing at all about whether it is correct.

The tree it builds:

    git ls-tree --name-only HEAD
    .gitattributes
    .github
    .gitignore
    .nvmrc
    CONTRIBUTING.md
    DCO
    LICENSE
    NOTICE.md
    README.md
    SECURITY.md
    build
    client
    docs
    rust-toolchain.toml
    server

## What runs on a pull request

This guide does not list the checks, because a list in a document drifts against
the thing it describes and the drift is invisible until somebody trusts the
list. Two commands print them instead.

The workflows that exist:

    gh workflow list --repo iderex/kontor

The names a particular commit was actually judged under, which is the set a
required check would be matched against:

    gh api "repos/iderex/kontor/commits/$(git rev-parse HEAD)/check-runs" \
      --jq '.check_runs[].name'

The two answers are not the same set and are not meant to be. A workflow that
triggers only on a pull request contributes no check run to a commit reached any
other way, so the second command prints fewer names than the first on a commit
that arrived on the default branch. Read the second one against your own head
commit once the pull request exists.

## No work without an issue

Every change starts as an issue and lands as a pull request. Pushing to the
default branch is refused, including for the maintainer, and the refusal is a
property of the repository rather than a habit:

    gh api repos/iderex/kontor/rulesets --jq '.[] | select(.name == "gate") | .id'
    20486686
    gh api repos/iderex/kontor/rulesets/20486686 \
      --jq '{enforcement, bypass: .bypass_actors, required: [.rules[].type]}'
    {"bypass":[],"enforcement":"active","required":["deletion","non_fast_forward","pull_request"]}

An issue says three things.

What is wrong. Not what to build, but what is broken, missing or undecided, so
that a reader can disagree with the problem before arguing about the fix.

What the evidence is. Where the evidence is a number, the issue carries the
command that produced it, run against the reference the reader will have rather
than against a working tree. A number without its command cannot be checked and
cannot be seen to have moved.

What done means, in terms somebody other than the author can verify. An issue
whose done condition is a matter of taste has not stated one.

## Sign off your work

Every commit carries a `Signed-off-by:` trailer, and the name and address in it
match the commit author exactly. The trailer is an assertion of the Developer
Certificate of Origin, version 1.1, whose text is in [DCO](DCO). Read it once
before you sign anything, because signing is what it means rather than a
formality the tooling wants.

As you commit:

    git commit -s

On work already committed, where `<base>` is the commit your branch left the
default branch at:

    git rebase --signoff <base>

The check runs on every pull request and fails closed. One commit anywhere in
the branch without a trailer matching its author reds it, and the failure names
the commit and the exact line it wanted. Confirm it ran against your own head:

    gh api "repos/iderex/kontor/commits/$(git rev-parse HEAD)/check-runs" \
      --jq '.check_runs[] | select(.name | test("DCO")) | "\(.name) \(.conclusion)"'

## Every test runs headless and unelevated

The default test suite runs with no display server, no administrative rights and
no reachable network, and a test that needs a display, a live network, a
simulator or a database is marked for which of those it needs and is excluded
from the default run by configuration rather than by a flag anybody has to
remember.

Nothing enforces that today and no command lists the marked tests, because
neither the suite nor the marking exists. #7 defines the marking and owes the
command that prints it, and #5 builds the suite it would print from. The rule is
stated here so that the first test written is written under it, not so that a
reader can check it.

## Commit messages

State what changed and what failure it prevents. Where the change is a
correction, say what was wrong and how it was found, because the second is what
stops the same defect arriving again by a different route.

One topic per commit and one per pull request. A commit carrying two unrelated
changes gets a message describing one of them, and the other one lands
undescribed.

## English, and no attribution to a tool

Everything tracked in this repository is written in English. Nothing tracked
carries a tool name, a generated-by marker or an attribution for how the work
was produced. What a change says about itself is what it changed and why.
